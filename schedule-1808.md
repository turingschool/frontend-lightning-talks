# 1808 Lightning Talks :zap:

### Overview

* Everyone in Module 1 is required to give a lightning talk.
* A lightning talk is 5 minutes long. We'll time you, and we will have a cut off at 5 minutes. We suggest you run through your talk at least once to make sure you have enough time to cover the content!
* Presentations are in front of the class.
* You may select a topic from the list provided below. 
* If you'd like to propose an alternate topic, let instructors know. Alternate topics require instructor approval. 
* Topics are first come first serve basis.

### Picking a Topic

* You don't need to be an expert on a topic. You can do the research and become expert enough to deliver a valuable talk. This is a great opportunity to learn about something you're curious about.
* A talk needs to teach something of value to the audience.
* A talk needs to be at an appropriate level for the audience, not too basic and not too advanced.
* A talk needs to have a *message*, not just a subject. "Introduction to HTML Canvas" is boring, "Why You Should Use HTML Canvas" has a message.

### How To

1. Fork this repository 
2. Edit the `schedule-1808.md` file by inserting your topic next to your name. Presentations start at the beginning of the allotted block in the calendar and we'll roll through each presentation. 

	```
	- Penelope: History of Women In Tech 
	```

3. Submit a Pull Request *to this repository* (not your forked repo), titled like so: `FirstName LastName: Title of Talk`

	* Note: We review submissions based on when pull requests are submitted. *You may not see that a topic has been taken if we have not yet merged an earlier pull request to master. We'll let you know as quickly as possible if your proposed topic is already taken.*

4. At some point before the day of your lightning talk, touch base with your instructors to run through your content. **You** are responsible for reaching out to schedule this. It is not required to physically meet (unless you'd like) - An outline of your talk via Slack is sufficient for approval.
